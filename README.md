# Relative-Strength-Index-Leader
RSIL - Relative Strength Index Leader - Technical Indicator in Pine Script (TradingView platform)

what will happen for the RSI if the price will increases or decreases by X percent? This indicator takes your hands.

For instance:
You set Leader1 = 1 and Leader2 = -1 (by default), So this indicator shows you that if the price will increase 1% (Leader1) or decrease 1% (Leader2) How much the RSI will be?

So you have 3 horns, One of them main RSI that shows the amount of RSI right now, and 2 others show what will happen for RSI if the price increase or decrease by X percent.
